# TODO List

This is an app for a TODO list.

## Functionality

You should be able to dynamically 'CRD', maybe 'Update', the TODO's. Furthermore, they should be able to put under different 'projects' for the sake of organizing.

## Layout

The app should consist of a main page where you can see the TODO's of the project 'General'. From there you can navigate to the different projects and see TODO\*s for each of them.

The creation of new TODO's is available from each page.

### Construction of TODO-items

Every TODO should have:

1. Project of TODO
2. Name
3. Descripton of what needs to be done
4. Due Date
5. Priority - HiGH, MEDIUM or LOW
6. Checkmark of completion

## TODO's ðŸ˜‹

- ~~Create TODO's (object/class)~~
- ~~Show them with checkmarks~~
- ~~Remove them~~
- Inspect further/expand
  The expanded todo should have the edit button. The edit DOM should either replace all other things or work in-place.
  - (Edit)
- ~~Add projects~~
  - ~~(Select from projects when creating TODO)~~
- Add localstorage so the data isn't lost on refresh
- Do a little bit of styling
